# Turk Worker Tutorial Modes of conversation

# Task Description

For this task you will be given a conversation and you will be asked to categorize the types conversation that best describe each clause in the sentence. Your tasks will be limited to scenarios of two speakers, each with independent backgrounds. The speakers will be focused on any number of subjects, but will convey their opinions, facts, as well as other information during these exchanges.

The task requires you to identify what we call a **mode of conversation** for each phrase or sentence. A mode of conversation is a label for the type of conversation that a speaker is currently engaging in. For example, let’s say Speaker A says “I live in a small town.” You’d categorize that as something relating to “Identity” then “Identifying characteristic”. 

In response, Speaker B might ask “Where is that?” - you’d first classify this phrase as a question, then as a “context based question”.


# How to complete a HIT

Completing a HIT should be intuitive. When you accept the HIT, you will be greeted by a page that looks like this:

On the left you’ll see the entire conversation. Use this to clarify any phrase or sentence that depends on context. On the right you’ll see the labelling panel.

The Utterance will appear in the top text area, preceded by the speaker identity. Underneath this section, you will be met with a set of buttons with general modes of conversation as labels.

When you click on a button, the list will change to a new set of buttons that represent the subcategories of this mode. Choose a subcategory and you will assign an annotated to the phrase.

If you did not mean to click on a super-category of conversation, you can always go back by clicking the `Home` link.

If you need to fix any mode of conversation, you can navigate back and forth using the navigation buttons above the Phrase box.

Once you have labelled every phrase/sentence in the text - the `Submit HIT!` button will become clickable and you can get credit for your work!
